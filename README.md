# FeatherBB Fluid Nav

## Description

Want a touch of web 2.0 in your forum without ÃœBER javascript frameworks ? Based on the excellent [PJAX-Loader](https://github.com/thybag/PJAX-Standalone), this plugin loads new content when clicking on links *without page reload*.

## Dependencies

Please install the featured [Assets Compacter](https://github.com/featherbb/assets-compacter) plugin in order to get everything working as expected. As of its present structure, the present script may miss stylesheets or other javascript files if you don't, resulting in... Let's say bad surprises.  
As well, if you include custom JS files in **Assets Compacter**, make sure they are sandboxed to avoid errors.

## Changelog

### v0.1.0
Initial commit.
